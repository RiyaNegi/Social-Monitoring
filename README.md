# Social Monitoring Dashboard

This project was built on react and flask. 

With this application we are able to utilize data for data interpretations and visualizations such as Outreach prediction, word cloud, sentiment analysis and brand mentions. 

The outreach prediction where by analyzing the previous trends and training the dataset we can predict the target audience outreach the post would have even before it goes live. This quick feedback for start-ups and companies helps them to quickly implement the changes required thus saving resources and ensuring to always get a higher chance of being visible on social media platforms.


## Objectives 
1. **Predicting Outreach** of various campaigns, posts and marketing strategies by predicting the impact it will have on the internet.
2. **Collecting Data from Public APIs** of multiple social media sites and storing them on a mysql database.
3. **Analysing** the indexed data and visualizing it via data visualization tools.
4. **Making strategic** market and business decisions based on the data shown on the dashboard.

## Public APIs used
1. PRAW / Tweepy  API
2. Youtube Data API V3
3. Twitter API V2
